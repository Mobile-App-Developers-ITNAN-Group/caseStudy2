This is a project about registration implementing verification and authentication manually.

This UI was created with hard-coded without using any packages, this UI design got inspired by an app (Gojek). Furthermore, This UI focuses on a clean design with a soft color scheme. We implemented the image that we put on the asset and also for the text field we are using Textformfield where here we can check the input whether is valid or invalid input. Hence, for the routing parts we are using Navigator.pushName() to make it easier to navigate.

For the backend, we're using the Firebase service and connected the application with the Firestore database. We're implementing the authentication manually so there are not many authentication packages that we use and the app code goes straight to the Firestore database with the authentication logic that we created inside the code by ourselves (hard-coded).
